<!--- so lets get rid of everything and figure out where we broke this thing ->
<! DOCTYPE html>

<!--- So this is my idea so far. I want to break up my conversation into 4 rounds of the game we played. I want to add a custom background to give it a little texture and add imagery for jokes we make. I want several pages leading off from the main conversation to represent the tangents we go on about the different actors and movies we talk about, where we debate each other, etc... I want play around with a sleak layout. with some early web-esque features like cheesy rotating images and glowing text (i had alot of trouble trying to get these effects to work and ended up breaking other things in my layout, I'll have an example of these features ready for next class. I definetly want the layout to be sleaker and cleaner. -->



<!--- UPDATE -->

<!--- My code was extremely broken at the end of last week. I let myself spend far too long trying to fix all of my old code and didn't give myself enough enough time to rebuild everything from scratch. I'd definety like more time if possible. I appologize for my sloppy work. -->

Ethan  - …. I  …… I will concede to you that he's B list for now
Kris - Ethan, do you think hes higher or lower
Ethan - I-I don't know. He kind of exists outside of space and time for me. He’s not a person. 
Kris - he’s an enigma of an actor 
Mike - who are we talking about? 
Kris - Dax Shepard?
Ethan - Kristen bell's husband

Ethan - okay. You sound unsure, do you believe this person is C list
Mike - i think in the grand scheme of things yes they are but because of people know his name now, people will go see what's he's in but he's literally only done like one thing. But because of that one thing was so outrageous, people will go see him if he's in it.

Mike - YES! That's what i mean!  He's a C actor, he only did one thing and it was horrible but because of the recent movie people will go see that movie because he's in it. because people know the one thing he has done was so outrageously bad.
